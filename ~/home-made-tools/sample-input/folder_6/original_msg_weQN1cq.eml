Here are this week's three links that are worth your time:

1. Here are 330 Ivy League courses you can take online right now for free
(browse-able list): https://fcc.im/2C6En8m

2. 3 years ago I was just a 30-something teacher coding in his closet. But
yesterday, the IRS granted freeCodeCamp Tax Exempt status. And freeCodeCamp
is now a public charity. As a result, every donation you=E2=80=99ve ever ma=
de to
freeCodeCamp is now tax deductible. Here's what all this means for you and
for the global freeCodeCamp community (3 minute read):
https://fcc.im/2BjNVjJ

3. If you're considering freelancing or creating a startup, this is a
must-watch. My friend Luke Ciciliano - who does freelance web development
for law firms - will walk you through the best way to set up your US
business for tax purposes (21 minute watch): https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=3DAtIB_3_DZUk

Bonus: Elvis was just a village boy from Nigeria who had nothing but a
dream and a Nokia J2ME feature phone. Today, he's a 19 year old Android
developer who has worked on over 50 apps and currently works for an MIT
startup. On this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I tell his
inspiring story of how he built apps using nothing more than his feature
phone (15 minute listen): https://fcc.im/2EdyvMb



Happy coding!
